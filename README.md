(Be warned, English might be not perfect)

Hello, I'm a 15 year old student at a small high school in the netherlands intrested in machine learning and overall programming.
I'm not a pro at c++ so don't blame me for the messy code :P. On the other hand all tips and comments are welcome.

to understand exactly what a i'm doing here you should need a basic understanding of neural networks.
a great channel on youtube from Jeff Heaton explains the baiscs (search him on youtube :P)

The network uses the sigmoidal function as the activation function,
The learning algorithm i use is the backpropagation algorithm. 
The network has 2 input neurons, 2 hidden layers, and 1 output neuron. also the hidden layer and the output layer is supported by a additional bias neuron(a neuron with a constant value of 1)

About this program,
This is my first fully funtional Neural network capable of learning the XOR problem.
XOR is a simple boolean based operator
1 and 1 equals 0
1 and 0 equals 1
0 and 1 equals 1
0 and 0 equals 0

The code might not be the most beautiful code, but hey i'm a beginner.
However, this code is written fairly simple, so every one that has a bit of a background in mathematics and programming should be able to understand this code.

So please play with it and give tips and comments. And contact me!!

Greetings,
